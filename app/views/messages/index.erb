<h1>All Messages</h1>

<!--below we are using erb to create html by having Ruby embedded code -->
<% @messages.each do |message| %>
  <div class = "message">

<!--below is so that they can click on "message" to bring them to a page to see them. Originally we had: 
    <h3><%= message.title %> <small>(by: <%= message.author %>)</small></h3>
then we changed it to below so they could be clicked on -->
    <h3><a href="/messages/<%= message.id%>"><%= message.title %></a> <small>(by: <%= message.author %>)</small></h3>
    <p>
      <%= message.content %>
